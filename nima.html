        <h3>Exercise:<mark>7 benefits of regular physical activity</mark></h3>
        <p>
          You know exercise is good for you, but do you know how good? From

          can improve your life.

          <h4>1. Exercise controls weight</h4>
          <p>
            Exercise can help prevent excess weight gain or help you keep off
            lost weight. When you take part in physical activity, you burn
            calories. The more intense the activity, the more calories you burn.

          <p>
            Regular trips to the gym are great, but don't worry if you can't
            find a large chunk of time to exercise every day. Any amount of
            activity is better than none. To gain the benefits of exercise, just
            get more active throughout your day. For example, take the stairs
            instead of the elevator or rev up your household chores. Consistency
            is key.

          <h4>2. Exercise combats health conditions and diseases</h4>
          <p>
            Worried about heart disease? Hoping to prevent high blood pressure?
            No matter what your current weight is, being active boosts
            high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, the "good" cholesterol,
            and it decreases unhealthy triglycerides. This one-two punch keeps
            your blood flowing smoothly, which lowers your risk of heart and
            blood vessel, called cardiovascular, diseases.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regular exercise helps prevent or manage many health problems and
            concerns, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Stroke.</li>
            <li>Metabolic syndrome.</li>
            <li>High blood pressure.</li>
            <li>Type 2 diabetes.</li>
            <li>Depression.</li>
            <li>Anxiety.</li>
            <li>Many types of cancer.</li>
            <li>Arthritis.</li>
            <li>Falls.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Need an emotional lift? Or need to lower stress after a stressful
            day? A gym session or brisk walk can help. Physical activity
            stimulates many brain chemicals that may leave you feeling happier,
            more relaxed and less anxious. You also may feel better about your
            appearance and yourself when you exercise regularly, which can boost
            your confidence and improve your self-esteem.

          <h4>4. Exercise boosts energy</h4>
          <p>
            Winded by grocery shopping or household chores? Regular physical
            activity can improve your muscle strength and boost your endurance.
            Exercise sends oxygen and nutrients to your tissues and helps your
            cardiovascular system work more efficiently. And when your heart and
            lung health improve, you have more energy to tackle daily chores.

          <h4>5. Exercise promotes better sleep</h4>

          <p>
            Struggling to snooze? Regular physical activity can help you fall
            asleep faster, get better sleep and deepen your sleep. Just don't
            exercise too close to bedtime, or you may be too energized to go to
            sleep.

          <h4>6. Exercise puts the spark back into your sex life</h4>
          <p>
            Do you feel too tired or too out of shape to enjoy physical
            intimacy? Regular physical activity can improve energy levels and
            give you more confidence about your physical appearance, which may
            boost your sex life. But there's even more to it than that. Regular
            physical activity may enhance arousal for women. And men who
            exercise regularly are less likely to have problems with erectile
            dysfunction than are men who don't exercise.

          <h4>7. Exercise can be fun â€” and social!</h4>
          <p>
            Exercise and physical activity can be fun. They give you a chance to
            unwind, enjoy the outdoors or simply do activities that make you
            happy. Physical activity also can help you connect with family or
            friends in a fun social setting. So take a dance class, hit the
            hiking trails or join a soccer team. Find a physical activity you
            enjoy, and just do it. Bored? Try something new, or do something
            with friends or family.
