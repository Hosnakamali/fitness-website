              You know exercise is good for you, but do you know how good? From

              <h4>1. Exercise controls weight</h4>
              <p>
                Exercise can help prevent excess weight gain or help you keep off
                lost weight. When you take part in physical activity, you burn
                calories. The more intense the activity, the more calories you burn.

                Regular trips to the gym are great, but don't worry if you can't
                find a large chunk of time to exercise every day. Any amount of
                activity is better than none. To gain the benefits of exercise, just
                get more active throughout your day. For example, take the stairs
                instead of the elevator or rev up your household chores. Consistency
                is key.

              <h4>2. Exercise combats health conditions and diseases</h4>
              <p>
                Worried about heart disease? Hoping to prevent high blood pressure?
                No matter what your current weight is, being active boosts
                high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, the "good" cholesterol,
                and it decreases unhealthy triglycerides. This one-two punch keeps
                your blood flowing smoothly, which lowers your risk of heart and
                blood vessel, called cardiovascular, diseases.
              </p>
              <p>
                Regular exercise helps prevent or manage many health problems and
                concerns, including:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Stroke.</li>
                <li>Metabolic syndrome.</li>
                <li>High blood pressure.</li>
                <li>Type 2 diabetes.</li>
                <li>Depression.</li>
                <li>Anxiety.</li>
                <li>Many types of cancer.</li>
                <li>Arthritis.</li>
                <li>Falls.</li>

              <p>
                Need an emotional lift? Or need to lower stress after a stressful
                day? A gym session or brisk walk can help. Physical activity
                stimulates many brain chemicals that may leave you feeling happier,
                more relaxed and less anxious. You also may feel better about your
                appearance and yourself when you exercise regularly, which can boost
                your confidence and improve your self-esteem.

              <h4>4. Exercise boosts energy</h4>
              <p>
                Winded by grocery shopping or household chores? Regular physical
                activity can improve your muscle strength and boost your endurance.
                Exercise sends oxygen and nutrients to your tissues and helps your
                cardiovascular system work more efficiently. And when your heart and
                lung health improve, you have more energy to tackle daily chores.

              <h4>5. Exercise promotes better sleep</h4>

              <p>
                Struggling to snooze? Regular physical activity can help you fall
                asleep faster, get better sleep and deepen your sleep. Just don't
                exercise too close to bedtime, or you may be too energized to go to
                sleep.

              <h4>6. Exercise puts the spark back into your sex life</h4>
              <p>
                Do you feel too tired or too out of shape to enjoy physical
                intimacy? Regular physical activity can improve energy levels and
                give you more confidence about your physical appearance, which may
                boost your sex life. But there's even more to it than that. Regular
                physical activity may enhance arousal for women. And men who
                exercise regularly are less likely to have problems with erectile
                dysfunction than are men who don't exercise.

              <h4>7. Exercise can be fun — and social!</h4>
              <p>
                Exercise and physical activity can be fun. They give you a chance to
                unwind, enjoy the outdoors or simply do activities that make you
                happy. Physical activity also can help you connect with family or
                friends in a fun social setting. So take a dance class, hit the
                hiking trails or join a soccer team. Find a physical activity you
                enjoy, and just do it. Bored? Try something new, or do something
                with friends or family.
