        <p>Personal training is a one-on-one experience that helps you achieve the absolute best RESULTS. Why do most
            people seek a Personal Trainer? The three biggest reasons are knowledge, accountability, and motivation.</p>
        <p>At Club Fitness we pride ourselves on providing the best trainers with the highest qualifications – you will
            be training with industry experts! All one-on-one sessions come with a complimentary Wellness Assessment to
            gauge your fitness baseline. The wellness assessment helps determine your starting point and the steps
            needed to achieve your fitness goals.</p>
        <h3>Kids Exercise Their Minds - You Focus On YOU!</h3>

        <p>To ensure our Kids Club is industry-leading, Club Fitness has partnered with Brain Balance, which is designed
            to teach children about behavioral skills, focus, academic performance, impulsiveness, and much more.
            Fundamentally, the Brain Balance approach focuses on the concept of finding the balance between the left
            brain and the right brain. The left brain is the academic, cognitive side where motor skills, language,
            speech, math skills, and memory take place; while the right brain is the behavioral and emotional center
            where attention, impulse control, reading comprehension, and emotional reactions take place.</p>
